<p>
This is a web application that displays an interactive 3D chainsaw model, which responds to API requests by animating or moving the chainsaw. It utilizes WebGL and popular libraries like Three.js to render the 3D model, making it possible for users to view and interact with the chainsaw in a dynamic way.
</p>

## Features
- **Interactive 3D Model**: Users can rotate, zoom, and explore the chainsaw model.
- **API Interaction**: The chainsaw model moves or animates when a POST request is made to the API endpoint.
- **Smooth Animation**: The chainsaw reacts with smooth, real-time movement when the API is hit, such as starting the engine or rotating the blade.
  
## Technologies Used
- **Three.js**: A powerful JavaScript library for rendering 3D graphics in the browser using WebGL.
- **Node.js / Express**: For handling the API requests and serving the web application.
